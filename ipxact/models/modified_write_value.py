    means that in a bitwise fashion each write data bit of a one will
    set the corresponding bit in the field.  'oneToToggle' means that in
    a bitwise fashion each write data bit of a one will toggle the
    corresponding bit in the field. 'zeroToClear' means that in a
    bitwise fashion each write data bit of a zero will clear the
    corresponding bit in the field. 'zeroToSet' means that in a bitwise
    fashion each write data bit of a zero will set the corresponding bit
    in the field. 'zeroToToggle' means that in a bitwise fashion each
    write data bit of a zero will toggle the corresponding bit in the
    field. 'clear' means any write to this field clears the field. 'set'
    means any write to the field sets the field. 'modify' means any
    write to this field may modify that data. If this element is not
