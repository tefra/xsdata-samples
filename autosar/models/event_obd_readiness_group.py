    :ivar event_obd_readiness_group: This attribute specifies the Event
        OBD Readiness group for PID $01 and PID $41 computation. This
        attribute is only applicable for emission-related ECUs.

        atpVariation stereotype.
    :ivar s: Checksum calculated by the user's tool environment for an
        ArObject. May be used in an own tool environment to determine if
        an ArObject has changed. The checksum has no semantic meaning
        for an AUTOSAR model and there is no requirement for AUTOSAR
        tools to manage the checksum.

        ArObject. May be used in an own tool environment to determine
        the last change of an ArObject. The timestamp has no semantic
        meaning for an AUTOSAR model and there is no requirement for
        AUTOSAR tools to manage the timestamp.
