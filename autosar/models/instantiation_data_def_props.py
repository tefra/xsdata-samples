class InstantiationDataDefProps:
    """This is a general class allowing to apply additional SwDataDefProps to
    particular instantiations of a DataPrototype.

    Typically the accessibility and further information like alias names
    for a  particular data is modeled on the level of DataPrototypes
    (especially  VariableDataPrototypes, ParameterDataPrototypes). But
    due to the recursive  structure of the meta-model concerning data
    types (a composite (data) type consists  out of data prototypes) a
    part of the MCD information is described in the data  type (in case
    of ApplicationCompositeDataType). This is a strong restriction in
    the reuse of data typed because the data type should be re-used  for
    different VariableDataPrototypes and ParameterDataPrototypes to
    guarantee type  compatibility on C-implementation level (e.g. data
    of a Port is stored in PIM  or a ParameterDataPrototype used as ROM
    Block and shall be typed by the same data type as NVRAM Block). This
    class overcomes such a restriction if applied properly.

    :ivar parameter_instance: This is the particular
        ParameterDataPrototypes on which the swDataDefProps shall be
        applied.
    :ivar sw_data_def_props: These are the particular data definition
        properties which shall be applied
    :ivar variable_instance: This is the particular
        VariableDataPrototypes on which the swDataDefProps shall be
        applied.
    :ivar variation_point: This element was generated/modified due to an
        atpVariation stereotype.
    :ivar s: Checksum calculated by the user's tool environment for an
        ArObject. May be used in an own tool environment to determine if
        an ArObject has changed. The checksum has no semantic meaning
        for an AUTOSAR model and there is no requirement for AUTOSAR
        tools to manage the checksum.
    :ivar t: Timestamp calculated by the user's tool environment for an
        ArObject. May be used in an own tool environment to determine
        the last change of an ArObject. The timestamp has no semantic
        meaning for an AUTOSAR model and there is no requirement for
        AUTOSAR tools to manage the timestamp.
