    This meta-class is created to add the ability to become the target of a
    reference to the non-Referrable PncMapping.

    :ivar short_name: This specifies an identifying shortName for the
        object. It needs to be unique within its context and is intended
        for humans but even more for technical reference.
    :ivar short_name_fragments: This specifies how the
        Referrable.shortName is composed of several shortNameFragments.
    :ivar s: Checksum calculated by the user's tool environment for an
        ArObject. May be used in an own tool environment to determine if
        an ArObject has changed. The checksum has no semantic meaning
        for an AUTOSAR model and there is no requirement for AUTOSAR
        tools to manage the checksum.
    :ivar t: Timestamp calculated by the user's tool environment for an
        ArObject. May be used in an own tool environment to determine
        the last change of an ArObject. The timestamp has no semantic
        meaning for an AUTOSAR model and there is no requirement for
        AUTOSAR tools to manage the timestamp.
