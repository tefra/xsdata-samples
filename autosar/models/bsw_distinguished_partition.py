    context the code of the enclosing  BswModuleBehavior can be executed.

    The intended use case is to distinguish between several partitions
    in order to implement different behavior per partition, for example
    to behave either as a master or satellite in a multicore ECU with
    shared BSW code.

    :ivar short_name: This specifies an identifying shortName for the
        object. It needs to be unique within its context and is intended
        for humans but even more for technical reference.
    :ivar short_name_fragments: This specifies how the
        Referrable.shortName is composed of several shortNameFragments.
    :ivar variation_point: This element was generated/modified due to an
        atpVariation stereotype.
    :ivar s: Checksum calculated by the user's tool environment for an
        ArObject. May be used in an own tool environment to determine if
        an ArObject has changed. The checksum has no semantic meaning
        for an AUTOSAR model and there is no requirement for AUTOSAR
        tools to manage the checksum.
    :ivar t: Timestamp calculated by the user's tool environment for an
        ArObject. May be used in an own tool environment to determine
        the last change of an ArObject. The timestamp has no semantic
        meaning for an AUTOSAR model and there is no requirement for
        AUTOSAR tools to manage the timestamp.
