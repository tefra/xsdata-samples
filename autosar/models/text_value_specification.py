    The purpose of TextValueSpecification is to define the labels that
    correspond to enumeration values.

    :ivar short_label: This can be used to identify particular value
        specifications for human readers, for example elements of a
        record type.
    :ivar variation_point: This element was generated/modified due to an
        atpVariation stereotype.
    :ivar value: This is the value itself. Note that vt uses the |
        operator to separate the values for the different bitfield masks
        in case that the semantics of the related DataPrototype is
        described by means of a BITFIELD_TEXTTABLE in the associated
        CompuMethod.
    :ivar s: Checksum calculated by the user's tool environment for an
        ArObject. May be used in an own tool environment to determine if
        an ArObject has changed. The checksum has no semantic meaning
        for an AUTOSAR model and there is no requirement for AUTOSAR
        tools to manage the checksum.
    :ivar t: Timestamp calculated by the user's tool environment for an
        ArObject. May be used in an own tool environment to determine
        the last change of an ArObject. The timestamp has no semantic
        meaning for an AUTOSAR model and there is no requirement for
        AUTOSAR tools to manage the timestamp.
