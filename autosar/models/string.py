    This represents a String in which white-space shall be normalized
    before processing.

    For example: in order to compare two Strings: * leading and trailing
    white-space needs to be removed * consecutive white-space (blank, cr,
    lf, tab) needs to be replaced by one blank.

    :ivar s: Checksum calculated by the user's tool environment for an
        ArObject. May be used in an own tool environment to determine if
        an ArObject has changed. The checksum has no semantic meaning
        for an AUTOSAR model and there is no requirement for AUTOSAR
        tools to manage the checksum.

        ArObject. May be used in an own tool environment to determine
        the last change of an ArObject. The timestamp has no semantic
