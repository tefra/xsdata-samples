class ISignalToIPduMapping:
    """
    An ISignalToIPduMapping describes the mapping of ISignals to ISignalIPdus
    and defines the position of the ISignal within an ISignalIPdu.

    :ivar short_name: This specifies an identifying shortName for the
        object. It needs to be unique within its context and is intended
        for humans but even more for technical reference.
    :ivar short_name_fragments: This specifies how the
        Referrable.shortName is composed of several shortNameFragments.
    :ivar long_name: This specifies the long name of the object. Long
        name is targeted to human readers and acts like a headline.
    :ivar desc: This represents a general but brief (one paragraph)
        description what the object in question is about. It is only one
        paragraph! Desc is intended to be collected into overview
        tables. This property helps a human reader to identify the
        object in question. More elaborate documentation, (in particular
        how the object is built or used) should go to "introduction".
    :ivar category: The category is a keyword that specializes the
        semantics of the Identifiable. It affects the expected existence
        of attributes and the applicability of constraints.
    :ivar admin_data: This represents the administrative data for the
        identifiable object.
    :ivar introduction: This represents more information about how the
        object in question is built or is used. Therefore it is a
        DocumentationBlock.
    :ivar annotations: Possibility to provide additional notes while
        defining a model element (e.g. the ECU Configuration Parameter
        Values). These are not intended as documentation but are mere
        design notes.
    :ivar i_signal_group_ref: Reference to an ISignalGroup that is
        mapped into the SignalIPdu. If an ISignalToIPduMapping for an
        ISignalGroup is defined, only the UpdateIndicationBitPosition
        and the transferProperty is relevant. The startPosition and the
        packingByteOrder shall be ignored. Each ISignal contained in the
        ISignalGroup shall be mapped into an IPdu by an own
        ISignalToIPduMapping. The references to the ISignal and to the
        ISignalGroup in an ISignalToIPduMapping are mutually exclusive.
    :ivar i_signal_ref: Reference to a ISignal that is mapped into the
        ISignalIPdu. Each ISignal contained in the ISignalGroup shall be
        mapped into an IPdu by an own ISignalToIPduMapping. The
        references to the ISignal and to the ISignalGroup in an
        ISignalToIPduMapping are mutually exclusive.
    :ivar packing_byte_order: This parameter defines the order of the
        bytes of the signal and the packing into the SignalIPdu. The
        byte ordering "Little Endian" (MostSignificantByteLast), "Big
        Endian" (MostSignificantByteFirst) and "Opaque" can be selected.
        For opaque data endianness conversion shall be configured to
        Opaque. The value of this attribute impacts the absolute
        position of the signal into the SignalIPdu (see the
        startPosition attribute description). For an ISignalGroup the
        packingByteOrder is irrelevant and shall be ignored.
    :ivar start_position: This parameter is necessary to describe the
        bitposition of a signal within an SignalIPdu. It denotes the
        least significant bit for "Little Endian" and the most
        significant bit for "Big Endian" packed signals within the IPdu
        (see the description of the packingByteOrder attribute). In
        AUTOSAR the bit counting is always set to "sawtooth" and the bit
        order is set to "Decreasing". The bit counting in byte 0 starts
        with bit 0 (least significant bit). The most significant bit in
        byte 0 is bit 7. Please note that the way the bytes will be
        actually sent on the bus does not impact this representation:
        they will always be seen by the software as a byte array. If a
        mapping for the ISignalGroup is defined, this attribute is
        irrelevant and shall be ignored.
    :ivar transfer_property: Defines how the referenced ISignal
        contributes to the send triggering of the ISignalIPdu.
    :ivar update_indication_bit_position: The UpdateIndicationBit
        indicates to the receivers that the signal (or the signal group)
        was updated by the sender. Length is always one bit. The
        UpdateIndicationBitPosition attribute describes the position of
        the update bit within the SignalIPdu. For Signals of a
        ISignalGroup this attribute is irrelevant and shall be ignored.
        Note that the exact bit position of the
        updateIndicationBitPosition is linked to the value of the
        attribute packingByteOrder because the method of finding the bit
        position is different for the values mostSignificantByteFirst
        and mostSignificantByteLast. This means that if the value of
        packingByteOrder is changed while the value of
        updateIndicationBitPosition remains unchanged the exact bit
        position of updateIndicationBitPosition within the enclosing
        ISignalIPdu still undergoes a change. This attribute denotes the
        least significant bit for "Little Endian" and the most
        significant bit for "Big Endian" packed signals within the IPdu
        (see the description of the packingByteOrder attribute). In
        AUTOSAR the bit counting is always set to "sawtooth" and the bit
        order is set to "Decreasing". The bit counting in byte 0 starts
        with bit 0 (least significant bit). The most significant bit in
        byte 0 is bit 7.
    :ivar variation_point: This element was generated/modified due to an
        atpVariation stereotype.
    :ivar s: Checksum calculated by the user's tool environment for an
        ArObject. May be used in an own tool environment to determine if
        an ArObject has changed. The checksum has no semantic meaning
        for an AUTOSAR model and there is no requirement for AUTOSAR
        tools to manage the checksum.
    :ivar t: Timestamp calculated by the user's tool environment for an
        ArObject. May be used in an own tool environment to determine
        the last change of an ArObject. The timestamp has no semantic
        meaning for an AUTOSAR model and there is no requirement for
        AUTOSAR tools to manage the timestamp.
    :ivar uuid: The purpose of this attribute is to provide a globally
        unique identifier for an instance of a meta-class. The values of
        this attribute should be globally unique strings prefixed by the
        type of identifier.  For example, to include a DCE UUID as
        defined by The Open Group, the UUID would be preceded by "DCE:".
        The values of this attribute may be used to support merging of
        different AUTOSAR models. The form of the UUID (Universally
        Unique Identifier) is taken from a standard defined by the Open
        Group (was Open Software Foundation). This standard is widely
        used, including by Microsoft for COM (GUIDs) and by many
        companies for DCE, which is based on CORBA. The method for
        generating these 128-bit IDs is published in the standard and
        the effectiveness and uniqueness of the IDs is not in practice
        disputed. If the id namespace is omitted, DCE is assumed. An
        example is "DCE:2fac1234-31f8-11b4-a222-08002b34c003". The uuid
        attribute has no semantic meaning for an AUTOSAR model and there
        is no requirement for AUTOSAR tools to manage the timestamp.
