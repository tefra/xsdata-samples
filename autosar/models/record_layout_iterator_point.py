    It can be an integer or one of the keywords MAX-TEXT-SIZE|ARRAY-
    SIZE. Note that negative numbers are counted backwards. Therefore
    e.g. -1 refers to the last value.

    :ivar s: Checksum calculated by the user's tool environment for an
        ArObject. May be used in an own tool environment to determine if
        an ArObject has changed. The checksum has no semantic meaning
        for an AUTOSAR model and there is no requirement for AUTOSAR
        tools to manage the checksum.

        ArObject. May be used in an own tool environment to determine
        the last change of an ArObject. The timestamp has no semantic
