    This meta-class represents the fact that a particular scale of the computation
    method is constant.

    :ivar compu_const: This represents the fact that the scale is a
        constant. The use case is mainly a non interpolated scale. It is
        a simplification of the fact that a constant scale can also be
        expressed as rational function of order 0.
    :ivar s: Checksum calculated by the user's tool environment for an
        ArObject. May be used in an own tool environment to determine if
        an ArObject has changed. The checksum has no semantic meaning
        for an AUTOSAR model and there is no requirement for AUTOSAR
        tools to manage the checksum.
    :ivar t: Timestamp calculated by the user's tool environment for an
        ArObject. May be used in an own tool environment to determine
        the last change of an ArObject. The timestamp has no semantic
        meaning for an AUTOSAR model and there is no requirement for
        AUTOSAR tools to manage the timestamp.
