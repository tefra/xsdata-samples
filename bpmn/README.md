# Business Process Model and Notation [2.0.2](https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0.2/)

## Notes


This suite demonstrates really rare aspects of xsd like subclasses with 
different namespaces and conflicting global elements with substitution groups.

- Auto generated models
- Verify parsing from sample


## Makefile commands

```console
$ ./run.py build bpmn
$ ./run.py test bpmn
