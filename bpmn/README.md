# Business Process Model and Notation [2.0.2](https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0.2/)

## Notes

This suite demonstrates really rare aspects of xsd like subclasses with different
namespaces and conflicting global elements with substitution groups.

- Auto generated models
- Verify parsing from sample

## Invoke Commands

```console
$ inv bpmn.build
$ inv bpmn.test
$ inv bpmn.mypy
