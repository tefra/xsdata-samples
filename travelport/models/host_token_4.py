@dataclass
class HostToken4:
    """This is a host token.

    It contains some kind of payload we got from a host that must be
    passed in on successive calls they know who you are as our system
    does not maintain state. The format of this string isn't important
    as long as it is not altered in any way between calls. Since a host
    token is only valid on the host it is assocated with, there is also
    an attribute called Host so we know how to route the command(s). You
    can have multiple active sessions between one or more hosts

    Parameters
    ----------
    value
    host
        The host associated with this token
    key
        Unique identifier for this token - use this key when a single
        HostToken is shared by multiple elements.
    el_stat
        This attribute is used to show the action results of an element.
        Possible values are "A" (when elements have been added to the UR)
        and "M" (when existing elements have been modified). Response only.
    key_override
        If a duplicate key is found where we are adding elements in some
        cases like URAdd, then instead of erroring out set this attribute to
        true.
