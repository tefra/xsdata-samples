    """MetadataAttributeType describes the structure of a metadata attribute.

    The metadata attribute takes its semantic, and in some cases it
    representation, from its concept identity. A metadata attribute may
    be coded (via the local representation), uncoded (via the text
    format), or take no value. In addition to this value, the metadata
    attribute may also specify subordinate metadata attributes. If a
    metadata attribute only serves the purpose of containing subordinate
    metadata attributes, then the isPresentational attribute should be
    used. Otherwise, it is assumed to also take a value. If the metadata
    attribute does take a value, and a representation is not defined, it
    will be inherited from the concept it takes its semantic from. The
    optional id on the metadata attribute uniquely identifies it within
    the metadata structured definition. If this id is not supplied, its
    value is assumed to be that of the concept referenced from the
    concept identity. Note that a metadata attribute (as identified by
    the id attribute) definition  must be unique across the entire
    metadata structure definition.

    :ivar metadata_attribute:
    :ivar min_occurs: The minOccurs attribute indicates the minimum
        number of times this metadata attribute must occur within its
        parent object.
    :ivar max_occurs: The maxOccurs attribute indicates the maximum
        number of times this metadata attribute can occur within its
        parent object.
    :ivar is_presentational: The isPresentational attribute indicates
        whether the metadata attribute should allow for a value. A value
        of true, meaning the metadata attribute is presentational means
        that the attribute only contains child metadata attributes, and
        does not contain a value. If this attribute is not set to true,
        and a representation (coded or uncoded) is not defined, then the
        representation of the metadata attribute will be inherited from
        the concept from which it takes its identity.
