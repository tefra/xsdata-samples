    """AttributeType describes the structure of a data attribute, which is defined
    as a characteristic of an object or entity.

    The attribute takes its semantic, and in some cases it
    representation, from its concept identity. An attribute can be coded
    by referencing a code list from its coded local representation. It
    can also specify its text format, which is used as the
    representation of the attribute if a coded representation is not
    defined. Neither the coded or uncoded representation are necessary,
    since the attribute may take these from the referenced concept. An
    attribute specifies its relationship with other data structure
    components and is given an assignment status. These two properties
    dictate where in a data message the attribute will be attached, and
    whether or not the attribute will be required to be given a value. A
    set of roles defined in concept scheme can be assigned to the
    attribute.

    :ivar concept_role: ConceptRole references concepts which define
        roles which this attribute serves.
    :ivar attribute_relationship: AttributeRelationship describes how
        the value of this attribute varies with the values of other
        components. These relationships will be used to determine the
        attachment level of the attribute in the various data formats.
    :ivar measure_relationship: MeasureRelationship identifies the
        measures that the attribute applies to. If this is not used, the
        attribute is assumed to apply to all measures.
    :ivar usage: The usage attribute indicates whether an attribute
        value must be available for any corresponding existing
        observation.
