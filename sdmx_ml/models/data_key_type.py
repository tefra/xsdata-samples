    """DataKeyType is a region which defines a distinct full or partial data key.

    The key consists of a set of values, each referencing a dimension
    and providing a single value for that dimension. The purpose of the
    key is to define a subset of a data set (i.e. the observed value and
    data attribute) which have the dimension values provided in this
    definition. Any dimension not stated explicitly in this key is
    assumed to be wild carded, thus allowing for the definition of
    partial data keys.

    :ivar include: The include attribute has a fixed value of true for a
        distinct key, since such a key is always assumed to identify
        existing data or metadata.
