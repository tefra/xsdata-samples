    """<ns1:p xmlns:ns1="http://www.sdmx.org/resources/sdmxml/schemas/v3_0/data/structurespecific">ObsType is the abstract type which defines the structure of a grouped or un-grouped observation. The observation must be provided a key, which is either a value for the dimension which is declared to be at the observation level if the observation is grouped, or a full set of values for all dimensions in the data structure definition if the observation is un-grouped. This key should disambiguate the observation within the context in which it is defined (e.g. there should not be another observation with the same dimension value in a series). The observation can contain an observed value and/or attribute values.</ns1:p>
    <ns1:p xmlns:ns1="http://www.sdmx.org/resources/sdmxml/schemas/v3_0/data/structurespecific">Data structure definition schemas will derive a type or types based on this that is specific to the data structure definition and the variation of the format being expressed in the schema. The dimension value(s) which make up the key and the data and metadata attribute values associated with the key dimension(s) or the primary measure will be represented with XML attributes. This is specified in the content model with the declaration of anyAttributes in the "local" namespace. The derived observation type will refine this structure so that the attributes are explicit. The XML attributes will be given a name based on the attribute's identifier. These XML attributes will be unqualified (meaning they do not have a namespace associated with them). The dimension XML attribute(s) will be required while the attribute XML attributes will be optional. To allow for generic processing, it is required that the only unqualified XML attributes in the derived observation type be for the observation dimension(s) and attributes declared in the data structure definition. If additional attributes are required, these should be qualified with a namespace so that a generic application can easily distinguish them as not being meant to represent a data structure definition dimension or attribute.</ns1:p>

    :ivar comp: Comp contains the details of observation measures or
        attributes that have complex representation and cannot be
        expressed as XML attributes.
    :ivar metadata: Allows for attachment of reference metadata against
        to the observation.
    :ivar type_value: The type attribute is used when the derived format
        requires that explicit measure be used. In this case, the
        derived type based on the measure will fix this value to be the
        identification of the measure concept. This will not be
        required, but since it is fixed it will be available in the post
        validation information set which will allow for generic
        processing of the data. If explicit measures are not used, then
        the derived type will prohibit the use of this attribute.
    :ivar time_period: The TIME_PERIOD attribute is an explicit
        attribute for the time dimension. This is declared in the base
        schema since it has a fixed identifier and representation. The
        derived series type will either require or prohibit this
        attribute, depending on whether time is the observation
        dimension. If the time dimension specifies a more specific
        representation of time the derived type will restrict the type
        definition to the appropriate type.
