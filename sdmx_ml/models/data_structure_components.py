class DataStructureComponents(DataStructureComponentsType):
    """DataStructureComponents defines the grouping of the sets of metadata
    concepts that have a defined structural role in the data structure definition.

    Note that for any component or group defined in a data structure
    definition, its id must be unique. This applies to the identifiers
    explicitly defined by the components as well as those inherited from
    the concept identity of a component. For example, if two dimensions
    take their identity from concepts with same identity (regardless of
    whether the concepts exist in different schemes) one of the
    dimensions must be provided a different explicit identifier.
    Although there are XML schema constraints to help enforce this,
    these only apply to explicitly assigned identifiers. Identifiers
    inherited from a concept from which a component takes its identity
    cannot be validated against this constraint. Therefore, systems
    processing data structure definitions will have to perform this
    check outside of the XML validation. There are also two reserved
    identifiers in a data structure definition; TIME_PERIOD, and
    REPORTING_YEAR_START_DAY. These identifiers may not be used outside
    of their respective defintions (TimeDimension and
    ReportingYearStartDay). This applies to both the explicit
    identifiers that can be assigned to the components or groups as well
    as an identifier inherited by a component from its concept identity.
    For example, if an ordinary dimension (i.e. not the time dimension)
    takes its concept identity from a concept with the identifier
    TIME_PERIOD, that dimension must provide a different explicit
    identifier.
