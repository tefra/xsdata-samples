    """<ns1:p xmlns:ns1="http://www.sdmx.org/resources/sdmxml/schemas/v3_0/data/structurespecific">AttsType is the abstract type which defines a structure which is used to group a collection of data or metadata attributes which have a key in common. The key for a attribute collection is a subset of the dimension defined in the data structure definition. This is also used for data set level attributes (i.e. those with an attribute relationship of none). In this case, the subset of dimensions is empty.</ns1:p>
    <ns1:p xmlns:ns1="http://www.sdmx.org/resources/sdmxml/schemas/v3_0/data/structurespecific">Data structure definition schemas will derive a type based on this that is specific to the data structure definition. The dimension values which make up the key  will be represented with local (non-namespace qualified) XML attributes. The metadata attribute values associated with the key dimensions will be expressed as XML local (non-namespace qualified) attributes if they are simple values (e.g. enumerated, dates, numbers) and are not repeatable. Metadata attributes that are repeatable, or do not have simple values (e.g. text) will be expressed using the Comp element. This dimensions and simple attributes are specified in the content model with the declaration of anyAttributes in the "local" namespace. The derived series type will refine this structure so that the attributes are explicit. The XML attributes will be given a name based on the attribute's identifier. These XML attributes will be unqualified (meaning they do not have a namespace associated with them). The dimension XML attributes will be required while the attribute XML attributes will be optional. To allow for generic processing, it is required that the only unqualified XML attributes in the derived group type be for the series dimensions and attributes declared in the data structure definition. If additional attributes are required, these should be qualified with a namespace so that a generic application can easily distinguish them as not being meant to represent a data structure definition dimension or attribute.</ns1:p>

    :ivar comp: Comp contains the details of the data or metadata
        attributes that have complex representation and cannot be
        expressed as XML attributes.
    :ivar time_period: The TIME_PERIOD attribute is an explict attribute
        for the time dimension. This is declared in the base schema
        since it has a fixed identifier and representation. The derived
        series type will either require or prohibit this attribute,
        depending on whether time is the observation dimension. If the
        time dimension specifies a more specific representation of time
        the derived type will restrict the type definition to the
        appropriate type.
