    """DimensionType describes the structure of an ordinary dimension, which is
    defined as a statistical concept used (most probably together with other
    statistical concepts) to identify a statistical series, such as a time series,
    e.g. a statistical concept indicating certain economic activity or a
    geographical reference area.

    The dimension takes its semantic, and in some cases it
    representation, from its concept identity. A dimension can be coded
    by referencing a code list from its coded local representation. It
    can also specify its text format, which is used as the
    representation of the dimension if a coded representation is not
    defined. Neither the coded or uncoded representation are necessary,
    since the dimension may take these from the referenced concept.
