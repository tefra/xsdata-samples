    """<ns1:p xmlns:ns1="http://www.sdmx.org/resources/sdmxml/schemas/v3_0/data/structurespecific">GroupType is the abstract type which defines a structure which is used to communicate attribute values for a group defined in a data structure definition. The group can consist of either a subset of the dimensions defined by the data structure definition, or an association to an attachment constraint, which in turn defines key sets to which attributes can be attached. In the case that the group is based on an attachment constraint, only the identification of group is provided. It is expected that a system which is processing this will relate that identifier to the key sets defined in the constraint and apply the values provided for the attributes appropriately.</ns1:p>
    <ns1:p xmlns:ns1="http://www.sdmx.org/resources/sdmxml/schemas/v3_0/data/structurespecific">Data structure definition schemas will drive types based on this for each group defined in the data structure definition. Both the dimension values which make up the key (if applicable) and the attribute values associated with the group will be represented with XML attributes. This is specified in the content model with the declaration of anyAttributes in the "local" namespace. The derived group type will refine this structure so that the attributes are explicit. The XML attributes will be given a name based on the attribute's identifier. These XML attributes will be unqualified (meaning they do not have a namespace associated with them). The dimension XML attributes will be required while the attribute XML attributes will be optional. To allow for generic processing, it is required that the only unqualified XML attributes in the derived group type be for the group dimensions and data or metadata attributes declared in the data structure definition. If additional attributes are required, these should be qualified with a namespace so that a generic application can easily distinguish them as not being meant to represent a data structure definition dimension or attribute.</ns1:p>

    :ivar comp: Comp contains the details of group level attributes that
        have complex representation and cannot be expressed as XML
        attributes.
    :ivar metadata: Allows for attachment of reference metadata against
        to the group.
    :ivar type_value: The type attribute reference the identifier of the
        group as defined in the data structure definition. This is
        optional, but derived group types will provide a fixed value for
        this so that it always available in the post validation
        information set. This allows the group to be processed in a
        generic manner.
