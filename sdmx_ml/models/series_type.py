    """<ns1:p xmlns:ns1="http://www.sdmx.org/resources/sdmxml/schemas/v3_0/data/structurespecific">SeriesType is the abstract type which defines a structure which is used to group a collection of observations which have a key in common. The key for a series is every dimension defined in the data structure definition, save the dimension declared to be at the observation level for this data set. In addition to observations, values can be provided for data and metadata attributes which are associated with the dimensions which make up this series key (so long as the attributes do not specify a group attachment or also have an relationship with the observation dimension). It is possible for the series to contain only observations or only attribute values, or both.</ns1:p>
    <ns1:p xmlns:ns1="http://www.sdmx.org/resources/sdmxml/schemas/v3_0/data/structurespecific">Data structure definition schemas will derive a type based on this that is specific to the data structure definition and the variation of the format being expressed in the schema. Both the dimension values which make up the key and the attribute values associated with the key dimensions will be represented with XML attributes. This is specified in the content model with the declaration of anyAttributes in the "local" namespace. The derived series type will refine this structure so that the attributes are explicit. The XML attributes will be given a name based on the attribute's identifier. These XML attributes will be unqualified (meaning they do not have a namespace associated with them). The dimension XML attributes will be required while the attribute XML attributes will be optional. To allow for generic processing, it is required that the only unqualified XML attributes in the derived group type be for the series dimensions and attributes declared in the data structure definition. If additional attributes are required, these should be qualified with a namespace so that a generic application can easily distinguish them as not being meant to represent a data structure definition dimension or attribute.</ns1:p>

    :ivar comp: Comp contains the details of series level attributes
        that have complex representation and cannot be expressed as XML
        attributes.
    :ivar obs:
    :ivar metadata: Allows for attachment of reference metadata against
        to the series.
    :ivar time_period: The TIME_PERIOD attribute is an explict attribute
        for the time dimension. This is declared in the base schema
        since it has a fixed identifier and representation. The derived
        series type will either require or prohibit this attribute,
        depending on whether time is the observation dimension. If the
        time dimension specifies a more specific representation of time
        the derived type will restrict the type definition to the
        appropriate type.
