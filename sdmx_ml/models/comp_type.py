    attribute.

    For example, a repeated value, a text value in multiple languages,
    or a value with structured text (XHTML) cannot be expressed as an
    XML attribute. This type is meant to be restricted based on the
    component to restrict the cardinality and type of its Value element
    to conform to the compoent definition. The type of the value element
    should be restricted to common:SimpleValueType,
    common:TextValueType, or common:StructuredValueType. In addition,
    the id attribute should be restricted to be a fixed value with the
    component identifier. This restricted type based on the component
    can then be used on Comp elements by using the xsi:type to state the
    component being expressed and refine the contents of the element to
    the values allowed by the component.
