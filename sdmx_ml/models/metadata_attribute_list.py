    defined as a hierarchy, for reporting reference metadata about a target object.

    The identification of metadata attributes must be unique at any
    given level of the metadata structure. Although there are XML schema
    constraints to help enforce this, these only apply to explicitly
    assigned identifiers. Identifiers inherited from a concept from
    which a metadata attribute takes its identity cannot be validated
    against this constraint. Therefore, systems processing metadata
    structure definitions will have to perform this check outside of the
    XML validation.
