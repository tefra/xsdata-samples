class TimeDimensionType(BaseDimensionType):
    """TimeDimensionType describes the structure of a time dimension.

    The time dimension takes its semantic from its concept identity
    (usually the TIME_PERIOD concept), yet is always has a fixed
    identifier (TIME_PERIOD). The time dimension always has a fixed text
    format, which specifies that its format is always the in the value
    set of the observational time period (see
    common:ObservationalTimePeriodType). It is possible that the format
    may be a sub-set of the observational time period value set. For
    example, it is possible to state that the representation might
    always be a calendar year. See the enumerations of the textType
    attribute in the LocalRepresentation/TextFormat for more details of
    the possible sub-sets. It is also possible to facet this
    representation with start and end dates. The purpose of such facts
    is to restrict the value of the time dimension to occur within the
    specified range. If the time dimension is expected to allow for the
    standard reporting periods (see common:ReportingTimePeriodType) to
    be used, then it is strongly recommended that the reporting year
    start day attribute also be included in the data structure
    definition. When the reporting year start day attribute is used, any
    standard reporting period values will be assumed to be based on the
    start day contained in this attribute. If the reporting year start
    day attribute is not included and standard reporting periods are
    used, these values will be assumed to be based on a reporting year
    which begins January 1.
