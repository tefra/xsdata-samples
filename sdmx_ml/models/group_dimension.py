    Although it is conventional to declare dimensions in the same order as they are declared in the ordered key, there is no requirement to do so - the ordering of the values of the key are taken from the order in which the dimensions are declared. Note that the id of a dimension may be inherited from its underlying concept - therefore this reference value may actually be the id of the concept.
