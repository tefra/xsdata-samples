# [Definitive XML Schema](http://www.datypic.com/books/defxmlschema/)

Historically this was the first integration test suite of xsdata.

It's based on the samples from the book by Priscilla Walmsley that cover most
of the basic XML Schema language traits

## Notes

- Auto generated models
- Verify xml and json bindings from samples

## Makefile commands

```console
$ make build-defxml
$ make test-defxml
$ make mypy-defxml
```
