class Month:
    """Month of publication.

    The month must be expressed in numeric format rather spelling out the name (e.g.. submit "10", not "October"). The month must be expressed with a leading zero if it is less than 10 (e.g. submit "05", not "5"). When a journal issue has both an issue number and a season, the issue number should be placed in issue. If the month of publication is not known, the season should be placed in month as a two-digit value as follows: Season Value Spring 21 Summer 22 Autumn 23 Winter 24 First Quarter 31 Second Quarter 32 Third Quarter 33 Fourth Quarter 34 In cases when an issue covers multiple months, e.g. "March-April", include only the digits for the first month of the range.
